# Why the canonical sequence is QUIT + relaunch (not just focus + keystroke):
# field note, 2026-05-23 (validated session): the Bridge plugin's launch handler
# will not re-initialize on an already-running Figma. Clicking the menu item
# only SELECTS it, and Cmd+Opt+P on a stale Figma also fails to re-establish
# the WebSocket. The only proven flow is:
#   kill stale MCP servers > graceful quit Figma > relaunch on URL > Cmd+Opt+P
# Fresh Figma state is what unblocks the plugin launch handler.
# (Step 5 below documents the trigger this script actually sends: a menu click.)
#
# Graceful quit (`osascript -e 'tell application "Figma" to quit'`) preserves the
# tabs that were open and lets Figma's shutdown handler run. NEVER `killall Figma`:
# that leaves Figma in a 0-window state where no plugin can attach.
#
# Set FIGMA_GENTLE=1 if you do NOT want to quit Figma. Gentle mode only kills
# stale MCP servers and clicks the plugin menu. Per the field note above it is
# the less reliable path, but it never quits Figma, so it is the default the
# skill uses: the user may be working in Figma right now. Run without it (the
# full quit + relaunch) only after the user said yes to a Figma restart.
#
# macOS only (osascript, open, launchctl, lsof, pgrep). The menu click needs the
# Accessibility permission on the app that runs this script and assumes the
# English Figma UI.

figma-bridge-reset.sh is macOS only (osascript, open, lsof, pgrep).
On this OS, recover by hand:
  1. Close the agent sessions you are not using (each one holds a
     figma-console-mcp server on a port in 9223-9232).
  2. Quit Figma DESKTOP normally (do not force-kill it) and reopen the file.
  3. Plugins > Development > "Figma Desktop Bridge" > Run.
     If it is not listed, import it once from
     ~/.figma-console-mcp/plugin/manifest.json.
  4. Leave the plugin window OPEN.
  5. Call figma_get_status: it is the only proof of a live connection.

# -- 1. Kill stale MCP servers LISTENing on 9223-9232 --------------------------
# Use `lsof -t -i tcp:PORT -s TCP:LISTEN` (not `-ti tcp:PORT`: that returns every
# PID with ANY connection to the port, including Figma helpers with an established
# WS connection. Killing those harms Figma without killing the actual server).

# MULTI-SESSION SAFETY: by default, only kill this session's MCP server. Set
# FIGMA_KILL_OTHER_SESSIONS=1 to kill all servers on 9223-9232 (the original
# behavior, dangerous when other Claude Code sessions are running because it
# kills their MCP servers too).
#
# How "this session's" is decided. In Claude Code (checked on macOS), each
# session's MCP server is a descendant of that session's `claude` process, and
# so is the shell that runs this script. A server is this session's when its
# nearest ancestor named $FIGMA_AGENT_PROCESS (default: claude) is the same
# process as this script's nearest one. Do NOT compare full ancestor chains:
# every session started from the same terminal app shares the terminal and
# `login` ancestors, so a full-chain match counts other sessions' servers as
# this session's and kills them. If no such ancestor is found, nothing counts
# as this session's and the default mode kills nothing.

If STILL disconnected:
  - The Bridge plugin was not the last plugin you ran. In Figma:
    Plugins > Development > "Figma Desktop Bridge" (the one WITHOUT the
    warning icon) > Run
  - Or: another Claude Code session is racing for port 9223. Close the
    other windows you are not using.
  - Or: the plugin is not imported yet. Import it once from
    ~/.figma-console-mcp/plugin/manifest.json (in the Figma file picker
    press Cmd+Shift+G and paste the path).
